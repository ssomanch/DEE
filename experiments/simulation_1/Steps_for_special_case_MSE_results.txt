Here we divide the steps for simulation 1 into three steps as there is huge memory requirement to run step 3. 


1. Change the run_all_replications_parallel.R to make sure we have CATE_ls = 0.2 and bias_ls = 0.5
2. Step 1, set N = 200K
3. Change the run_all_replications_parallel to include to run run_one_replication_upto_step2.makefile, specifically set --sample-at-RDD 1
4. Run make simulation_1_parallel
5. Run Rscript Create_step3_jobs.R
6. Then submit the jobs to run step3_sample_CATE_bias_and_Y. That is run, submit_all_jobs.sh
7. Change the run_all_replications_parallel.R back to run run_one_replication.makefile
8. Run make simulation_1_parallel
9. Rscript analyze_all_replications_modified.R
